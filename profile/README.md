Welcome on zenyt GitHub.

We are small company which doesn't really exist, but we have great plans.

IT is in our lives more than in 90s and we need tools to manage it and create new things that will help us to manage the grow and be prepared for anything. Nowadays, if you want to create some program it i complicated for you. You need to learn new programming language, but which one. This is easier with tools to create with that language Zenyt Ember. With simply design you can create big project and easy manage it. And that all for free (maybe for few dollars in future)

Be ready and welcome the future with Zenyt.
